ChemInsight Lab – README Template
# ChemInsight Lab

**ChemInsight Lab** is a modular toolkit for ligand docking, cavity benchmarking, and spectral visualization. It supports GUI-based workflows for comparative analysis across protein pockets, with a focus on reproducibility and educational outreach.

## 🔬 Features

- Ligand Loader panel for uploading `.sdf`, `.pdb`, `.mol` files
- Cavity Viewer with CurPocket data integration (C1–C5)
- Dock & Compare module for benchmarking docking scores
- PyMOL-based pose visualization and export
- Organized folder structure for ligands, proteins, and results

## 🧪 Current Workflow

- Protein: `1U72.pdb` (human DHFR)
- Ligand: `butane.sdf` (CID 7843)
- Docking tool: CB-Dock2
- Cavity data: C1–C5 with volume, center, and size
- Output: Word tables, PyMOL visuals, GUI panels



🎯 Goals
ChemInsight Lab aims to

•	Build a modular, GUI-driven toolkit for ligand docking, cavity benchmarking, and spectral analysis
•	Enable reproducible workflows for comparative docking across protein pockets (e.g., C1–C5 in 1U72)
•	Integrate FTIR overlays, pose visualizations, and branded infographics for outreach and citation impact
•	Support educational modules and freelance services in molecular modeling and biochemistry
•	Establish ChemInsight Lab as a recognized open science brand bridging human and plant biochemistry
